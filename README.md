#flickr toolset
A collection of tools that perform basic tasks with flickr.

##Description of the tools
* **Desktop Download:** This tool allows a you to automatically download one or a few sets that contain pictures which you can use for your desktop and/or screen saver.

* **Photo Download:** This tool downloads your complete flickr library as a backup to your computer. _Note: due to some problems with the current flickr API, the original quality videos are not available for download, flickr’s highest quality compressions are downloaded instead.  Original quality photos are downloaded._

* **Photo Upload:** This tool uploads photos that are placed in a photo automatically.  The benefit of this uploader is that it tries it’s best to preserve metadata (geo and date) as much as possible.
